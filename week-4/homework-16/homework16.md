# Homework 16

1. Setup an account on [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/).
2. Upload an image and then associate this image with one of your Volcano NFTs. Think about a way of automating image generation.
3. In the NFT's metadata set some attributes/traits which can be viewed on OpenSea.
4. See if you can figure out how to store the NFT's metadata on-chain with the contract. Hint look into the [Base64](https://github.com/Brechtpd/base64/blob/main/base64.sol) library. [Example](https://gist.github.com/farzaa/dc45da3eb91a41913767f3eb4d7830f1)
