## Unit Testing

Using your choice of hardhat, foundry or truffle:

1. Create a project for your Volcano Coin
2. Write unit tests for your Volcano Coin Contract showing that:

	1. The total supply is initially 10000
	2. That the total supply can be increased in 1000 steps
	3. Only the owner of the contract can increase the supply
