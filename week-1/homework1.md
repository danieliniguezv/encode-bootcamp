# Homework 1

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like Monopoly
would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
* What are the essential pieces of functionality?
* How could people cheat?
* How could you prevent from cheating?

## Answer

Monopoly is a board game where you buy and sell property and utility services.
Money is issued by a central bank and originally at the beginning is the 
same bak whom owns property and utility.

If we were to have a decentralised version of said boardgame then we would 
have that every player in the board game would initially have a record of the 
total amount of money available and the balances of each player. Property 
ownership records would also be held by the players.

At any given time when a transaction were to be performed eveybody should 
update their ledgers as to keep track of said transactions ocurring and for the 
ledger to de true at all times.

Considering that this game is designed to be played by 2 up to 8 players, 
this record could be easiyl kept by hand on a piece of paper by each player.

*Anyone* could be part of this control ledger, but not *everybody* might want 
to be part of it, as it entiles work, and nobody likes to work for free.

So as to make it attractive there must be an incentive then that makes this 
*menial* task worth the **time** of players that so decide to be involved 
with it. The incentive in this scenario could be *anything* as long as it 
makes the player *feel* that it was worth its time.

Players then must have communication at all times as to keep an up to date 
ledger.

Players could potentially cheat in a variety of ways. For instance players that 
may know each other from before could agree to some sort of secret coding 
or signaling of some sort that when the other party is aware of then they might 
tamper with the ledger as to both increase their amounts of money or change 
property ownership.

Following the above example as to how to prevent the misbehaving of said 
players. Say in this particular case is a face to face interaction then 
it would be required that no 2 players speak the same language and that 
they do not *provenly* know each other beforehand.

The list of possible misbehaviors is near to infinity for which constraints 
of the model would need to be thought of as well beforehand, otherwise this 
could potentially become an unsolvable problem of course.
