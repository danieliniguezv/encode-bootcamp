## Team gas optimization game

Follow the README instructions for the gas optimization team game in the [repo](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolidityBootcamp) found in 
the ```Exercise/Gas``` directory.

Your team should try to reduce the amount of gas used to deploy the contract, 
and when running transactions.

You can change the code as much as you like, but you must not change the tests, 
and the contract must pass all tests.
