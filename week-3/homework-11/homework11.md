# Homework 11

## Continue NFT development

1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an

2. Add a function to store a token URI.
3. What would be the problem to add a function that allows to change the token 
URI?
It would then be liable to point to any other URI not pointing to the stored item.
